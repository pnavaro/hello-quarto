::: notes
It unifies it for people who love R Markdown by reducing little points of friction, so that websites, books, and slides all have a common approach.

And it extends it for people who don't know RMarkdown by being a friendly way to work reproducibly and publish documents that have text and code in the same place

Some highlights of these improvements include

--\> consistent implementation of attractive and handy features across *all* outputs, like tabsets, code-folding, and syntax highlighting,

--\> more accessible defaults as well as better support for creating accessible documents,

--\> guardrails that are particularly helpful for new learners, like YAML completion and informative syntax errors,

--\> and perhaps most excitingly for those who are not coming from the R ecosystem, Quarto offers support for other languages like Python, Julia, Observable, and more via the Jupyter engine for executable code chunks.
And it's designed to be expandable to more engines and languages, even those that might not exist today.

[pause] So by now I'm assuming many of you have already started playing with Quarto, or you're waiting for me to do that.
So, let's dive in and see what all the Quarto fuss is about!

::: notes
Now that you've all had a chance to see Quarto in action, you might be wondering, "how are R Markdown and Quarto different"?

The main difference is that with R Markdown, the R package rmarkdown does the heavy lifting of going from the source Rmd file to the the output, using knitr for evaluating the code chunks.

--\> With Quarto, on the other hand, the Quarto command line interface, or the Quarto CLI, does the orchestration of processing executable code chunks with either knitr or jupyter and then converting the resulting markdown file to the desired output.

While this is technically impressive, I'll be honest, it's not exactly what sparked my interest in Quarto in the first place.
